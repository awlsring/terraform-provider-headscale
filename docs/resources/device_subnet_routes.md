# Enables the route with prefix "10.0.10.0/24" advertised by device 1
resource "headscale_device_subnet_routes" "device_1" {
    device_id = "1"
    routes = [ "10.0.10.0/24" ]
}

# Enables specific subnet routes for a device
resource "headscale_device_subnet_routes" "device_routes" {
    device_id = "2"
    routes = ["192.168.1.0/24", "10.0.10.0/24"]
