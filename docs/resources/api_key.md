# headscale_api_key (Resource)

The API key resource allows you to create an API key that can be used to interact with the Headscale API. By default keys that are created with this resource will expire in 90 days. Keys cannot be modified, so any change to the input on this resource will cause the key to be expired and a new key to be created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# An API Key that expires in the default 90 days
resource "headscale_api_key" "default" {}

# An API Key that expires in 1 week
resource "headscale_api_key" "week" {
    time_to_expire = "1w"
}

# Creates an API key with specific expiration date
resource "headscale_api_key" "terraform_key" {
    expiration = "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}

# Creates an API key with no expiration
resource "headscale_api_key" "permanent_key" {}
```
