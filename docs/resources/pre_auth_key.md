# headscale_pre_auth_key (Resource)

The pre auth key resource allows you to create a pre auth key that can be used to register a new device on the Headscale instance. By default keys that are created with this resource will be not reusable, not ephemeral, and expire in 1 hour. Keys cannot be modified, so any change to the input on this resource will cause the key to be expired and a new key to be created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# A pre auth key that expires in the default 1 hour
resource "headscale_pre_auth_key" "default" {
    user = "1"
}

# A pre auth key that expires in a week
resource "headscale_pre_auth_key" "week" {
    user = "1"
    time_to_expire = "1w"
}

# A pre auth key that is reusable
resource "headscale_pre_auth_key" "reusable" {
    user = "1"
    reusable = true
}

# A pre auth key that is ephemeral with tags
resource "headscale_pre_auth_key" "tags" {
    user = "1"
    ephemeral = true
    acl_tags = ["tag:test"]
}

# Creates a pre-auth key with multiple tags
resource "headscale_pre_auth_key" "with_tags" {
    user = "1"
    acl_tags = ["tag:server", "tag:production"]
}
```
